# Purpose
The primary purpose of creating a smaller subset of data is to better analyze a specific relationship. To better understand the increasing obesity rates in the United States, the subset compares adult obesity and physical inactivity rates. As physical inactivity rises, adult obesity typically follows, and the subest creates a smaller table to help visualize the relationship. Delaware is known for its beautiful outdoors and opportunities to stay active, so I focused on analyzing how the two variables relate to one another and how much they vary.  
- where did the data come from?
